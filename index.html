        <h2>Apply for an Independent Saving Bank Account</h2>
        <h3>Advice:</h3>
        <p>As a beginner, I advise you to start a Bank Account in a Govt. Bank as it would be much safer for you financially and more helpful. The 2 most efficient govt. banks are State Bank of India(SBI) and Bank Of Baroda(BOB), Links for both their websites are given below.</p>
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>The process of opening account for each bank is same but steps are not ina sequence so I would advice you to directly open the website of the bank and start to apply for a new bank account and if you stuck at any point, google the challenge or ask a senior at your home.</p>
